This the start point of logmotor product:
initial plan is to implement several common server log parsing and sending to django-socketio server by socketio-client, 
then to implement dynamic log file parser...(possible?)

Key features:

- realtime log change presentation to browser;
- log info visualize by Radar chart, and other chart(Gauge/Line);
- dynamic log parser create and config (*future);
- easy yet powerful log parse grammar, like sql manner (*future);
- log content search by key words;
