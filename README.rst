initial plan is to implement several common server log parsing and sending to django-socketio server by socketio-client, 
then to implement dynamic log file parser...(possible?)

Key features:

2. log info visualize by Radar chart, and other chart(Gauge/Line);
3. dynamic log parser create and config (*future);
4. easy yet powerful log parse grammar, like sql manner (*future);
5. log content search by key words;
